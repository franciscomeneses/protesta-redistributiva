The article attempts to balance this bias. The aim is to introduce and argue for another normative approach \textendash{} situational political socialization. Four theoretical elements constitute its basis: (1) the political, (2) contingency (the principle of the public sphere), (3) space and place, and (4) situation. In the contingent western digital media society marked by cultural dissemination, individualism, and the erosion of traditional institutions, situational political socialization represents a normative basis for a research approach which is open, action-oriented and contextualized, viewing young people as political actors in their own right.},

  abstract = {The American creed stresses political equality and political involvement, but substantial political inequality still persists from one generation to the next. Despite the importance of political inequality, not enough is known about the mechanisms that reproduce it. Political socialization research has focused on the transmission of political attitudes and culture across generations, but it has paid scant attention to how family transfers of economic resources, human capital, and social capital reproduce and perpetuate unequal patterns of political involvement and political authority. This article argues that more attention should be paid to measuring the persistence of political identity, political participation, civic engagement, and political influence networks over time and across generations. Special attention should be devoted to learning more about how the passage of family resources (economic resources, human capital, social capital, and cultural capital) from parents to children reproduces political inequality and reduces the opportunity for political mobility. Current data sources fall far short of what is needed to answer these questions, but linking the proposed American Opportunity Study with public voting records and with the American National Election Studies would provide a rich and powerful dataset for studying them.},

The analysis is performed in a multilevel framework, to account for both family socioeconomic status and individual school characteristics. The results support the hypothesis that social origin continues to have a strong influence on students' attitudes toward political participation, in the context of the two measurement points. The resulting discussion focuses on the role of schools in reducing socioeconomic differences, an issue that acquires additional relevance in societies with high inequality such as Chile.},

Consistent with Weber's assertions, we show that economic security and prospects are stratified more by class than by status, while the opposite is true for outcomes in the domain of cultural consumption. Within politics, class rather than status predicts Conservative versus Labour Party voting in British general elections and also Left-Right political attitudes. But it is status rather than class that predicts Libertarian-Authoritarian attitudes.},

I begin by describing different ways of measuring perceptions of inequality, and conclude that absolute measures\textemdash which ask respondents to estimate inequality in more concrete terms\textemdash tend to be more useful and accurate than relative measures.  I then describe how people understand inequality, highlighting the roles of cognitive heuristics, accessibility of information, self-interest, and context and culture.  I review the evidence regarding how people react to inequality, suggesting that inequality is associated with higher well-being in developing nations but lower well-being in developed nations, mostly because of hopes or fears for the future.  The evidence from developed nations suggests that inequality increases individuals' concerns about status and economic resources, increases their perception that the social world is competitive and individualistic, and erodes their faith in others, political systems, and democracy in general.},

I hypothesise that based on the psychological mechanism of self-serving bias in causal attribution, those who experience upward social mobility are more likely to support greater income differences, and that subjective intergenerational mobility has stronger association with attitudes towards income differences than objective mobility because individuals filter their objective environment in order to derive their subjective perceptions of the world and their own experiences. The described hypotheses are tested with two cross-national data sets \textendash{} European Values Studies and Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings are robust to alternative statistical specifications and indicate that individuals who perceive themselves as subjectively mobile have significantly different attitudes towards income differences in comparison to non-mobile groups, but that this effect does not manifest among objectively mobile individuals.},

Academic Press, New York, 1976), in the present work we examine belief in a just world as an underlying (latent) factor, reflected in general and personal beliefs. We first conducted a meta-analysis encompassing 51 articles, 76 samples, 19 countries and 23,900 participants, which revealed a positive association between the two forms of belief in a just world across studies (meta-analytic r\,=\,.52 [95\% CI\,=\,.48, .56], p\,{$<$}\,.001) and within each of the individual samples. These results suggest that general and personal belief in a just world could be treated as joint indicators of a latent belief in a just world factor. In a second study, an online sample of participants (n\,=\,311 participants, 54\% women, Mage\,=\,37.78~years) completed measures of general and personal belief in a just world, which we treated as indicators of latent belief in a just world. Measures of subjective well-being and psychological well-being were treated as indicators of latent well-being. Indicators loaded strongly on their respective latent factors, and the latent factors were strongly positively correlated (r\,=\,.74, p\,{$<$}\,.001). These results suggest that the link between belief in a just world and well-being may be even more substantial than has been previously recognized. In accordance with the original conceptualization of belief in a just world in justice motive theory, our results suggest benefits to examining the shared and unique aspects of general and personal beliefs in a just world.},

Recent research has studied the implications of Russell Dalton's argument that duty-based citizenship norms (emphasizing voting and obeying the law) are being replaced by engaged citizenship norms (emphasizing self-expressive and non-institutionalized forms of participation). In this article we use the 2009 International Civic and Citizenship Education Survey (n=140,650) to ascertain the cross-national empirical validity of engaged and duty-based norms. By means of latent class analysis, we show that both of these citizenship norms are indeed adhered to by different groups of adolescents. We also show, however, that only half of the research population holds these two norms, while other more traditional norms are also identified. The findings confirm expectations that high-status respondents with low political trust are more likely to adhere to engaged norms, but the country-level findings contradict expectations: engaged norms are less prevalent in highly developed stable democracies, and this casts doubts on the hypothesis that new engaged citizenship norms are predominantly found in stable highly developed democracies.},

These studies are classified using a framework consisting of three types of conceptions of inequality and two dimensions of inequality. Four perspectives are discussed explaining cross-national differences in views on inequality: the modernist, the culturalist, the micro and the macro perspective. The findings of studies comparing views on inequalities in post-communist and Western states provide more support for the modernist than for the culturalist perspective. Few comparative studies appear to investigate views on inequalities as independent variables impacting on other social attitudes and behaviours. It is argued that the social relevance of the field will be enhanced if more studies can show that views on inequality have an effect on social outcomes complementary to that of objective inequalities., L'\'etude fait le tour des comparaisons internationales qui ont analys\'e les opinions sur l'in\'egalit\'e. On peut les classer \`a partir de trois conceptions de l'in\'egalit\'e et de deux dimensions.

Les donn\'ees comparatives pour les pays ex-communistes et les pays occidentaux s'accordent mieux avec une perspective moderniste que culturaliste.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new theory of distributive justice, one that is fully mathematized and fully testable. The theory describes how choices made by individuals (about which goods to value, which social aggregates to form, and what conditions to regard as just or fair for themselves) combine with two objective structural features--the actual distributions of goods and their intercorrelations--to produce the sentiment of justice in the individual. The theory views social relations as a meeting of justice sentiments. Hence, a social aggregate is characterized by the distribution of justice sentiments experienced by its members; and the social aggregate's characteristic social facts are approximated by the parameters of the distribution of justice sentiments, such parameters as the proportion who feel unjustly underrewarded, the Gini's mean difference, the lower extreme value, the overall mean, and many others. By holding constant both the goods of value to the members of a social aggregate and the condition regarded by them as just or fair, it becomes possible to generate expected distributions of justice sentiments from knowledge of the actual distributions of goods, thereby enhancing the usefulness of the theory. In this paper, using three hypothetical distributions of goods (Rectangular, Pareto, and Lognormal), we generate the corresponding expected justice distributions--one negatively skewed Exponential, a family of positively skewed Exponentials, and a family of Normals--and evaluate many parameters of interest.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In a classical typology, Polanyi distinguishes three basic modes of economic integration: competitive market exchange, redistribution and reciprocity. While markets are dominant in modern capitalism, redistribution and reciprocity are\textemdash to varying extent\textemdash also part of its institutional architecture. Asking whether such institutional differences are mirrored in distinct `moral economies', we investigate ordinary citizens' support for market competition, redistribution and reciprocity across 14 capitalist economies. Combining data from three comparative surveys, we analyze, first, the extent to which these principles are supported by citizens and whether they cluster into distinct `moral economies'; second, whether these norms are anchored in formal institutional settings; and finally, how privileged and disadvantaged groups differ in their support. While support for market competition is strong across countries, it is to varying degrees complemented by support for redistribution and reciprocity. We identify a competition-dominated, an embedded and a strongly embedded moral economy. The interplay of formal institutions and people's social\textendash structural position partly explains differences in popular support.},

Drawing on the expectancy-value model of motivation, we begin to address this research gap while also considering several related issues. Our sample includes a diverse group of high school students in grades 10, 11, and 12 (N = 422) from the midwestern United States. Through quantitative analyses of participants' survey data, we found that political interest (a central aspect of value) and political efficacy (closely related to expectancy) predicted participants' expected future political participation, controlling for background characteristics\textemdash and that political interest was a particularly strong predictor. In addition, we identified political-engagement differences on various demographic measures, such as grade level. We also found a significant interaction between political interest and internal political efficacy, suggesting that high levels of both attitudes can have an especially positive effect on adolescents' political participation. We discuss the implications of these findings for researchers and educators interested in fostering political engagement among youth.},

They develop higher levels of political knowledge, show greater intention to vote in the future, and do better on a range of civic outcomes from petitioning and boycotting to raising money for charities and participating in community meetings (Torney-Purta et al. 2001; Andolina et al. 2003).},

  abstract = {En las \'ultimas d\'ecadas se ha observado una serie de amenazas a la democracia y su legitimidad. Por un lado, la persistente desigualdad en el acceso a las formas de voz pol\'itica y su v\'inculo estrecho con las condiciones socioecon\'omicas, mientras por otro, una serie de indicios que muestran una creciente desafecci\'on pol\'itica, particularmente de poblaciones juveniles. La preocupaci\'on por el futuro de la democracia ha volcado la mirada hacia las diversas fuentes de socializaci\'on pol\'itica y la formaci\'on de los futuros ciudadanos. Esta tesis doctoral trata acerca de la siguiente pregunta de investigaci\'on: \textquestiondown En qu\'e medida las desigualdades en las fuentes de socializaci\'on se relacionan con las diferentes expresiones de ciudadan\'ia en los j\'ovenes? Espec\'ificamente, \textquestiondown en qu\'e medida las caracter\'isticas socioecon\'omicas de la familia se traducen en actitudes y participaci\'on ciudadana de la siguiente generaci\'on? Aborda, por un lado, la pregunta acerca de \textquestiondown cu\'ales son las principales dimensiones de un concepto amplio de ciudadan\'ia juvenil?, y por otro, en la comprensi\'on sobre \textquestiondown qu\'e mecanismospermiten explicar el proceso de transmisi\'on intergeneracional de la desigualdad pol\'itica? Se organiza principalmente en torno una introducci\'on general y cuatro art\'iculos que abordan las preguntas de investigaci\'on formuladas. Para abordar dichas preguntas se hizo uso del Estudio Internacional de Educaci\'on C\'ivica y Ciudadana el a\~no 2009 (International Civic and Citizenship Study- ICCS 2009), que consideran estudiantes de 15 a\~nos provenientes de un set de 38 pa\'ises. Los datos provistos por ICCS representan una oportunidad \'unica para el estudio de fuentes de socializaci\'on pol\'iticas en diversos contextos y el abordaje de estas preguntas de investigaci\'on. Los resultados de esta tesis corroboran que la participaci\'on ciudadana juvenil puede ser entendida y medida como un concepto amplio que contiene diversos tipos de comportamiento organizados en tres dimensiones: participaci\'on formal, participaci\'on activista y participaci\'on comunitaria. As\'i mismo se cofirma que las actitudes hacia la igualdad de derechos puede ser medida como una composici\'on de las opiniones referidas a la igualdad de derechos de diversos grupos sociales hist\'oricamente excluidos. Respecto de la transmisi\'on intergeneracional de la desigualdad pol\'itica se observa que los recursos socioecon\'omicos ejercen una importante influencia en los diferentes tipos de participaci\'on y en las actitudes hacia la igualdad de derechos, siendo la educaci\'on lograda por lo padres y los libros disponibles en el hogar las formas de estratificaci\'on m\'as relevantes para explicar el comportamiento y las actitudes ciudadanas. La educaci\'on lograda por los padres y las consecuencias que ello implica para sus propias disposiciones democr\'aticas se traspasa a los hijos principalmente en forma de una mayor disposici\'on hacia la participaci\'on formal y mayor apoyo a la igualdad de g\'enero. En contraste, aquellas familias que presentan una mayor orientaci\'on hacia la cultura escolar, que se manifiesta en disponer de m\'as libros en el hogar, tienden a generar en sus hijos mayores disposiciones ciudadanas transversales, es decir, esos hijos est\'an dispuestos a participar m\'as y apoyan m\'as la igualdad de derechos para los diferentes grupos sociales. Esto implica que j\'ovenes que crecen en familias con m\'as recursos literarios en casa estar\'ian m\'as dispuestos a votar, a asistir a una marcha, a ayudar a resolver un problema de su comunidad y/o a apoyar la igualdad de derechos de todos los grupos sociales. Finalmente, confirmando lo argumentado por Schlozman, Verba, \& Brady (2012), las ventajas socioecon\'omicas se traducen en ventajas para el ejercicio de la ciudadan\'ia por dos v\'ias principalmente: por medio del ambiente pol\'itico m\'as rico que genera la familia (p.e. nivel de actividad pol\'itica) y/o la reproducci\'on del estatus familiar hacia la nueva generaci\'on, manifestado en la transmisi\'on de habilidades cognitivas necesarias para desarrollar un mayor estatus (p.e. habilidades c\'ivicas y/o conocimiento). Se discuten las principales contribuciones te\'oricas y emp\'iricas, las principales limitaciones y propuestas de futuras investigaci\'on.},

The model was tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and measurement equivalence for eighth-grade students (n = 139.875) across 38 countries that participated in the International Civic and Citizenship Study (2009). Our results find support for the proposed conceptual model and its invariance across countries, and we discuss the implications for theory and further research.},

Not only do schools prepare students for the `real' world but they also provide them with essential resources required for political participation. However, it is not always clear how schools can enhance young people's political participation. In this article, I empirically test how schools can encourage young people's political participation. Through a multilevel analysis, the simultaneous effect of formal civic education, active learning strategies and school characteristics on political participation among Flemish pupils is investigated. The evidence suggests that especially formal education and active learning strategies are successful in stimulating political participation. On the other hand, the level of political participation does not depend on school characteristics.},

Our review shows that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by the evidence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing policies. Likewise, voter preferences for the redistribution of wealth depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures, and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair. Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic process is captured by the rich; however, the evidence explaining when, where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful avenue for future research.},

The results revealed that the population could be categorized into two latent groups: one that determines preferences for social policies based on self-interest and another that does so based on ideology. Surprisingly, the results also showed that, compared to those who supported redistribution of wealth based on ideology, those who supported them based on self-interest were more likely to hold inconsistent preferences (e.g., simultaneous support for redistribution of wealth and free-market competition). This observation implies that, even when individuals want to determine their policy preferences rationally, they often do not have enough information to correctly assess the influence of each social policy on their self-interest.},

This study also analyses stages of inequality formation, namely market wage inequality and redistribution, and adds in a dynamic component to the model, completing the cycle of income distribution. The model is supported empirically with data from 18 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries from 1970 to 2009.
